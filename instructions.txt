OK, i need a slitgh change in the guest process:
I think the API we will call to get shipping rates required the full address detisl (from / to) and consequently,
we first need to get the address, then call the API (fake at this point) and then get the user to select the 
shipping option

page sequence: 
veryfy-claim
enter-address <-- new 
select-shipping
payment-success
